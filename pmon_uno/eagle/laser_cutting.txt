The enclosure is made of laser-cut acrylic top and bottom covers. The covers are designed
in eagle and are then imported to a InkSpace Ponoko project and adapted manually
per the Ponoko instructions here http://www.ponoko.com/starter-kits/inkscape.

cover_top.brd      - eagle drawing of the top cover.
cover_bottom.brd   - eagle drawing of the top cover.

Workflow
1. Design the parts in the respective eagle .brd files.
2. In eagle copy and the cutting design and temporarily paste in the board
   layout design. Make sure the cutting pattern matches the board's layout.
3. With the .brd files opened in Eagle, show only the 'dimension' layer and print
   the desings into respective .pdf files (must use scale of 1). Note that the 
   dimension layer includes also cutouts from the hole layer (good).
4. Create a new Inkspace file and import one of Ponoko's templates.
5. Import into the Inkspace file the two pdf files and place them within the 
   Ponoko project (duplicate as needed).
6. Set the lines' colors and widthes per Ponoko instructions.
7. Add engraving text as needed.
8. Save as InkSpace SVG and upload to Ponoko.
